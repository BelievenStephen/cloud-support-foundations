# Linux Foundation "Intro to Linux" notes

## What this course is aiming to teach

- Build working knowledge of Linux basics: navigating distros, configs/GUI basics, basic CLI operations, and common Linux use cases.
- Course is self-paced, chapters build on each other, knowledge checks are for reinforcement, final exam requires 70%+.

## Chapter 1: Course intro (key points)

- Use the class forum for peer discussion and troubleshooting help. Support system is for account/enrollment issues.
- Course uses formatting/color conventions to separate commands vs output vs filenames vs links.

## Chapter 2: The Linux Foundation + distribution families

### The Linux Foundation (what it is)

- The Linux Foundation is a major hub for open-source collaboration. It hosts/helps many large projects across infrastructure and software ecosystems, not just Linux.

### Three major Linux distribution families (and why they matter)

The course focuses on three distro families because most Linux systems you will run into in the real world map back to one of these.

#### 1) Red Hat family (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora, etc.)

- Fedora is often "upstream" testing for RHEL. CentOS has historically been close to RHEL, and CentOS Stream gets updates earlier than RHEL.
- Common package manager style: RPM-based, uses `dnf`.

#### 2) SUSE family (SLES, openSUSE)

- Similar relationship: enterprise (SLES) and community (openSUSE) are very close.
- Uses RPM-based `zypper` and includes YaST admin tooling.

#### 3) Debian family (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, etc.)

- Debian is upstream for Ubuntu. Ubuntu is upstream for Mint and others. Debian emphasizes stability and has a huge software repository.
- Uses APT tooling (`apt`, `apt-get`, etc.). Ubuntu is common in cloud deployments.

### Big idea: "distribution-flexible"

- Most Linux concepts and procedures carry across distros. The main differences are usually package managers, software versions, and file locations. Desktop environment used in the course is GNOME.

## Chapter 3: Linux philosophy, history, community, and terms

### Context for the course

- Linux changes constantly, so exact screens/features may drift over time.
- Some repetition is intentional to reinforce key skills (example: safe use of `sudo`).
- Course avoids "holy wars" (tool preference debates).
- Man pages are a core habit. Use `man <topic>` when you need details.

### Linux history (high level)

- Linus Torvalds started the Linux kernel in 1991. In 1992 it moved to the GPL, which helped create the global dev community and distributions.
- Today Linux runs a large share of servers, most smartphones via Android, most public cloud workloads, and essentially all top supercomputers.

### Linux philosophy (how it's built/why it works)

- Inspired by UNIX (but not UNIX). Strong focus on open collaboration.
- Key model: "everything is a file" style thinking (processes/devices/sockets often represented like files), plus multiuser, multitasking, networking, and background services (daemons).

### Linux community (where help comes from)

- Help channels include forums, IRC, GitHub/GitLab projects, mailing lists, and events. Linux.com is called out as a major community portal.

### Lab: "What OSS products do you use?"

**Examples listed:**

- Android, Apache, major platforms/services relying on OSS, supercomputers for weather, embedded Linux devices, etc.

### Core terminology (memorize these)

- **Kernel:** layer between hardware and apps.
- **Distribution:** Linux OS bundle (kernel + userland + tools).
- **Boot loader:** starts the OS (e.g., GRUB).
- **Service/daemon:** background process (e.g., `httpd`, `sshd`).
- **Filesystem:** how files are stored/organized (ext4, XFS, etc.).
- **Desktop environment / X Window system:** GUI layer on Linux (GNOME, KDE, etc.).
- **Shell / command line:** text interface and interpreter (bash, zsh, etc.).
